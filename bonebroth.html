        <h1>Equipment</h1>
            <p>Instant pot</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 pounds chicken, turkey, pork, beef, lamb, or other bones (try to get bones that have lots of connective tissue—feet, knuckles, necks, backs, etc.)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>4 cups roughly chopped carrots, onions, and celery (or scraps)</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>In the basin of an Instant Pot, place the bones, apple cider vinegar, carrots, onions, celery, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt.</li>
            <li>Fill pot with filtered water until it covers the bones by about an inch (or to the max fill line on the Instant Pot—whichever comes first). Let mixture rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Close lid and turn knob to sealing, set to cook on low pressure for 3 hours for poultry bones or 4 hours for red meat bones. When time is up, let the pressure release naturally.</li>
            <li>Strain broth through a fine mesh sieve, and transfer to jars for storing in the fridge or freezer.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, the broth should be jiggly and have a layer of fat on top. Scrape off the fat and use it for other purposes, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
