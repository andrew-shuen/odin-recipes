            <li>2 nappa cabbage</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>1 tsp ginger</li>
            <li>1/2 korean pear</li>
            <li>1/4 salted shrimp</li>
            <li>1 cup korean chili powder</li>
            <li>2 cups korean radish julienned</li>
            <li>1 bundle green onion chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>2 cups of water</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Split cabbage and cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>Dissolve 1 cup of salt and soak cabbages for 4-6 hours (need at least this long in order to get all the moisture out of them, otherwise the liquid pools when you start fermenting) until the cabbages lose stiffness </li>
            <li>Rinse cabbages 2-3 times in cold water and strain the water. Make sure the cabbages are completely drained</li>
            <li>Prepare rice slurry by dissolving the rice flour in cold water and bringing it to a boil. Stir it constantly until the mixture reaches the consistency of porridge. Let it cool completely.</li>
            <li>Grate garlic, ginger, onion, pear(optional), and salted shrimp. Add the slurry and chili powder to the mixture. </li>
            <li>Julienne radish, carrots and cut green onions on a bias. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl. </li>
            <li>Season the mixture with salt and sugar adjusting it to your taste. It should be slightly saltier then the desired outcome since the saltiness will be reduced by the sourness during the fermentation process.</li>
            <li>Take the cabbage and lay flat. Coat each layer of the cabbage with the filling. Fold over the leafy part and wrap around with the outer leaf to secure the filling.</li>
            <li>Stack them in a sealed container and press down to let the air out. Let kimchi to ferment at room temperature for 2-3 days. Don't eat kimchi that hasn't been fermented for more than 24 hours. The sugar I think gave me some pimple.</li>
        </ol>
